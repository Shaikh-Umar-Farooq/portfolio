        Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a
        nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually
        says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its
        ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in
        English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.” As Cicero would
        put it, “Um, not so fast.” The placeholder text, beginning with the line
        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like
        Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin. Richard
        McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited
        with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing
        a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a
        genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led
        McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the
        Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman
        philosopher Cicero. In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear
        an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work,
        with the most notable passage excerpted below: “Neque porro quisquam
        est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit,
        sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore
        magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.” A 1914 English translation by Harris
        Rackham reads: “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
        obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally
        circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
        pleasure.” Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was
        born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and
